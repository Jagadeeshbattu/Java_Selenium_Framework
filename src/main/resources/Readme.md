1.Data Driven Framework in Selenium is a method of separating data sets from the test case. Once the data sets are separated from the test case, it can be easily modified for a specific functionality without changing the code.
It is used to fetch test cases and suites from external files like Excel, .csv, .xml or some database tables.


2.Keyword Driven Framework in Selenium is a method used for speeding up automated testing by separating keywords for common set of functions and instructions. All the operations and instructions to be performed are written in some external file like an Excel sheet. Users can easily control and specify the functionalities they want to test.
